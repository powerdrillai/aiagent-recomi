## Project Background

This is a multi-package repository for Turborepo, responsible for implementing the Recomi chatbot functionality.

## Coding Standards

- Use functional components and Hooks, avoiding class components.
- Use TypeScript to provide type support for all components and utilities.
- Follow the style guides of
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended",
    "plugin:prettier/recommended" for code formatting.
- Use descriptive variable and function names.
- Use double quotes.
- Leave blank lines between code snippets and modules.
- Do not allow arbitrary use of type assertions; use type checks or other logical handling for type issues instead.

## Package Management Tool

- Use pnpm.

## Preferred Libraries

- Use Tailwind for styling.
- Use shadcn-ui for styled components, without introducing additional component libraries.

## File Structure

- components: Reusable UI components.
- pages: Page components.
- hooks: Custom Hooks.
- utils: Utility functions.
- types: Type definitions.
- apis: Request interfaces.

## Performance Optimization Guidelines

- Use React.memo for pure functional components.
- Implement lazy loading for route components.
- Optimize useEffect dependencies to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

## Documentation Standards

- Use JSDoc format for function and component comments.
- Each main directory must contain a README.md file.
- Provide both English and Chinese versions of the README.md file.

## Error Handling

- Use try/catch blocks to handle asynchronous operations.
- Implement a global error boundary component.
